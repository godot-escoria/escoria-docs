# ESCItem

**Extends:** [Area2D](../Area2D)

## Description

An ``ESCItem`` defines a (usually interactive) item in the game.

When interacting with an ``ESCItem``, the game character will automatically
walk to an ``ESCLocation`` that is created as a child of an ``ESCItem``.

By selecting the "Is Exit" checkbox when you create an ``ESCItem``
node, Escoria will look for an ``:exit_scene`` event in the attached script file.
Any commands you place in the ``:exit_scene`` event will be run when the player
chooses to "use" the exit - for example, saying a goodbye, or running a
cutscene. Place a ``change_scene`` command inside this event to move the
character to the next room.

## Constants Descriptions

### FORBIDDEN\_CHARACTERS

```gdscript
const FORBIDDEN_CHARACTERS: String = "['\"]"
```

List of forbidden characters in global_ids

### GROUP\_ITEM\_CAN\_COLLIDE

```gdscript
const GROUP_ITEM_CAN_COLLIDE: String = "item_can_collide"
```

Group for ESCItem's that can be collided with in a scene. Used for quick
retrieval of such nodes to easily change their attributes at the same time.

## Property Descriptions

export var global_id = ""
```

```gdscript
export var esc_script = ""
```

The ESC script for this item

### is\_exit

```gdscript
export var is_exit = false
```

If true, the ESC script may have an ``:exit_scene`` event to manage scene changes.
For simple exits that do not require scripted actions, the ``ESCExit`` node may be
preferred.

### is\_trigger

```gdscript
export var is_trigger = false
```

If true, object is considered as trigger. Allows using :trigger_in and
:trigger_out verbs in ESC scripts.

and be moved with commands like teleport and turn_to.

### player\_orients\_on\_arrival

```gdscript
export var player_orients_on_arrival = true

If true, player orients towards the direction corresponding to angle 
'interaction_angle' (in degrees) as player character arrives.

### interaction\_angle

```

Let the player turn to the direction corresponding to angle value
(in degrees) when the player arrives at the item.

### combine\_is\_one\_way

```gdscript
export var combine_is_one_way = false
```

If true, combination must be done in the way it is written in ESC script

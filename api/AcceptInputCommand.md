# AcceptInputCommand

**Extends:** [ESCBaseCommand](../ESCBaseCommand) < [Node](../Node)

## Description

`accept_input [type]`

Sets how much input the game is to accept. This allows for cut scenes
in which dialog can be skipped (if [type] is set to SKIP), and ones where
it can't (if [type] is set to NONE).


**Parameters**

- *type*: Type of inputs to accept (ALL)
  `ALL`: Accept all types of user input
  `SKIP`: Accept skipping dialogs but nothing else
  `NONE`: Deny all inputs (including opening menus)

**Warning**: `SKIP` and `NONE` also disable autosaves.

**Warning**: The type of use input accepted will persist even after the 
current event has ended. Remember to reset the input type at the end of
cut-scenes!

# CameraPushBlockCommand

**Extends:** [ESCCameraBaseCommand](../ESCCameraBaseCommand) < [ESCBaseCommand](../ESCBaseCommand) < [Resource](../Resource)

## Description

`camera_push_block target [time] [type]`

Pushes (moves) the camera so it points at a specific `target`. If the camera
was following a target (like the player) previously, it will no longer follow
this target. Blocks until the command completes.

Make sure the target is reachable if camera limits have been configured.

**Parameters**

- *target*: Global ID of the `ESCItem` to push the camera to. `ESCItem`s have
  a "camera_node" property that can be set to point to a node (usually an
  `ESCLocation` node). If the "camera_node" property is empty, `camera_push_block`
  will point the camera at the `ESCItem`s location. If however, the `ESCItem`
  has its "camera_node" property set, the command will instead point the
  camera at the node referenced by the `ESCItem`s "camera_node" property.
- *time*: Number of seconds the transition should take (default: `1`)
- *type*: Transition type to use (default: `QUAD`)

Supported transitions include the names of the values used
in the "TransitionType" enum of the "Tween" type (without the "TRANS_" prefix).

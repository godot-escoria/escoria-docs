# StopSndCommand

**Extends:** [ESCBaseCommand](../ESCBaseCommand) < [Resource](../Resource)

## Description

`stop_snd [audio_bus]`

Stops the given audio bus's stream.

By default there are 3 audio buses set up by Escoria : `_sound`, which is
used to play non-looping sound effects; `_music`, which plays looping music;
and `_speech`, which plays non-looping voice files (default: `_music`).

Each simultaneous sound (e.g. multiple game sound effects) will require its
own bus. To create additional buses, see the Godot sound documentation :
[Audio buses](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.html#doc-audio-buses)

**Parameters**

- *audio_bus*: Bus to stop ("_sound", "_music", "_speech", or a custom
  audio bus you have created.)

Advanced Escoria
================

This chapter includes all advanced topics of Escoria. These are not required
for a basic game but are recommended to make games unique and add required
features.

.. note::

    This chapter expects the developer to have a stable knowledge in Godot
    and GDScript.

    We'd recommend the following Godot documentation and experimenting
    with the features to build up the required knowledge:

    * `GDScript`_
    * `The Godot API`_
    * `Singletons (AutoLoad)`_

.. _GDScript: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html
.. _The Godot API: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/classes/index.html
.. _Singletons (AutoLoad): https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/getting_started/step_by_step/singletons_autoload.html

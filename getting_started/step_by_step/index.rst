.. Step by step guide

Step by step
============

This section of the documentation will guide you through the first steps of
creating a game based on Escoria in Godot.

It assumes that you have a very basic understanding of Godot and its basic
UI. The `editor introduction`_ is a good place to get to know Godot and
the editor if you're just starting out or need a bit of a refresher.

At a minimum, you should make sure that you have a basic understanding of the
terms :dfn:`node` and :dfn:`scene tree`, and be aware that Godot provides
different types of nodes for use. See the `nodes documentation`_ for details.

Understanding the Godot scripting language :dfn:`GDScript` is not required for
this guide, but it is definitely recommended for more advanced development. See
`GDScript basics`_ for more information.

Where to go from here
=====================

Congratulations! You build your very first game with Escoria. Well done!

But obviously, there's a lot more to do. We recommend checking out some more
stuff in this documentation. For example:

* :doc:`The ESC reference </getting_started/z_esc_reference>`
* :doc:`The Escoria settings reference </getting_started/z_escoria_settings>`
* :doc:`A walk through Escoria's architecture </advanced/escoria_architecture>`
* :doc:`How to create your own UI </advanced/create_ui>`

Also, don't be shy and say hello to the Escoria community and let's talk about
your specific ideas for the game:

Where to go from here
=====================

Congratulations! You've built your very first game with Escoria. Well done!

But obviously, there's a lot more to do. We recommend checking out the rest
of the documentation. For example:

* :doc:`The ESC reference </scripting/z_esc_reference>`
* :doc:`The Escoria settings reference </getting_started/z_escoria_settings>`
* :doc:`A walk through Escoria's architecture </advanced/escoria_architecture>`
* :doc:`How to create your own UI </advanced/create_ui>`

Additionally, for the final stages of your game, we recommend the following
Godot documentation:

* `Exporting Godot games`_
* `Complying with Godot and Escoria licenses`_

Also, don't be shy and say hello to the Escoria community! Let's talk about
your specific ideas for your game:

What is Escoria
===============

Escoria is a framework made for and with `Godot Engine 
<https://godotengine.org>`__ allowing you to create point and click adventure 
games. 

It provides you various special nodes and features to help you focus on creating
your rooms, items, characters, and puzzles. It will take care of all the common 
tasks that all adventure games need to have: character movements, transitions 
between rooms, items relations, etc. All you'll have to do is create all these 
elements for your game, and script the interactions.

It does not require you to be a Godot Engine specialist: all you'll need to know 
it the basics 
of Godot scenes and resources.
